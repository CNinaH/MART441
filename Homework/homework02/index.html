            <p>I am in my last semester at The University of Montana. I am expecting to graduate this May, which I am very excited for! I am going for Bachelor's of Art in Media Arts. I have learned a lot from this program and I am hoping to start my career in Graphic Design or Web Design.

        <div calss="Personal-About-Section">
            <p>I love art, music and video games. I have been doing art since I was a kid. My grandmother was huge influence on me. She was a billboard painter, this is before they were printed and digital. Since then, I have found animated films/shows and video games have inspired me to go into the digital art. I also do photgraphy of nature.<br>
            </br> My most recent memory of playing a video game is playing Ghost of Yote. Ghost of Tsushima is my favorite game, so when I got Ghost of Yote as an early birthday gift, I was very happy. I like more open world games since I can go at my own pace and wander around.
