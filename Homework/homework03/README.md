What you created? It is imple and it seems to be working!
What the generative AI/someone else created? I used ChatGPT and it showed more coding for JavaScript. 
How would you feel if you relied only on AI-generated output or someone else's work. I don't like it, it is nice to see the differnce but to rely on it, I would not truly learn for myself on how coding works. 
Whether you could adequately explain the code that was written? I understand the code it provided it used a lot of console.log. The promt used  "let favoritecolor = prompt" for the prompt and that is different from what I saw in this weeks examples.  
Whether the final work still feels like your own? No I would not consider this my own since I only asked it to create for me.
