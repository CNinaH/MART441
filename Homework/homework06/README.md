ChatGPT created a gamebord and displayed the images in 4 by 3 row. It created a grid within css. It showed the blank image and then when you clicked on them it showed all 6 different images but it did not duplicate. So there was no mathces. It did not create a code in JavaScript to make sure there was 2 of the same images shown. It added a shuffle to make sure the images would change order when the page refreshed. When revealed the images were alwasy in the 1st and 2nd row.
